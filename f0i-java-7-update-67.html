                            <p>I have been asked to look at a way of pushing out Java (i know, I am sad as well) via SCCM without killing running browsers and as little user impact as possible. Has anyone found a method of deployment that is completely in the background and will not kill IE in the process. Hey all - So aside from the "WTF you're going to break things" aspect of what I want to do, I'm just looking for advice/suggestions of HOW to do this. We're currently trying to crack down on vulnerable software on servers we have here, and we're "just" found out that there's TONS of different versions of Java on different servers. There's been a debate here for 4-5 years about who's supposed to be patching Java (Infrastructure which is me, or application owners who are putting 
Been collecting these and figured I'd share. These should be fairly up to date minus some Reader versions: REM Uninstall Java 8 Update 45 msiexec /x{26A24AE4\-039D\-4CA4\-87B4\-2F83218045F0} /q REM Uninstall Java 8 Update 31 msiexec /x {26A24AE4\-039D\-4CA4\-87B4\-2F83218031F0} /q REM Uninstall Java 8 Update 25 msiexec /x {26A24AE4\-039D\-4CA4\-87B4\-2F83218025F0} /q REM Uninstall Java 7 Update 67 msiexec /x {26A24AE4\-039D\-4CA4\-87B4\-2F03217067FF} /q REM Uninstall Java 7 Update. We have some manuals that have a decade old jar. The farthest we have been able to go is java 1.7 update 21 that has medium security setting set. I've tried to have Java run at a lower version but from the java console there is java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ruleset.xml ltruleset version="1.0+"gt ltrulegt ltid location="/server/docfolder" /gt ltaction permission="run" version="1.7.0_21" /gt lt/rulegt lt/rulesetgt. We use SCCM 2007 to deploy all of our software. We're trying to upgrade from Java 7 Update 67 to Java 8 Update 20. This isn't the first time I've deployed Java before--I've been deploying it via SCCM since Java 6 at about every other version. However, I'm scratching my head at this one. The Java installer simply refuses to install. In my program, this is what I'm running: jre-8u20-windows-i586.exe /s /L C:\javasetup.log INSTALL_SILENT=1 AUTO_UPDATE=0 EULA=0 NOSTARTMENU=1 STATIC=0 REBOOT=0. 
Okay guys, I read the links, I can't allocate more than 1 g of ram to TPPI, I have Java 7 Update 67 and run 16 gigs in my system, I know it's there. I just can't go higher than 1 gig. I read that I needed to update my java to 64 bit, which I did and still no luck. Any suggestions? I want to try this pack so bad! ------------------------------------------------------------ Edit 1: Okay, so I uninstalled my 32 bit java and installed the 64. That's up fine. I can allocate So, the goggles have done nothing; I beseech thee. I recently downloaded iRO via Steam after a fresh install of Windows 8.1 x86 (64bit) and while I can get the game to run, I've been having problems with loading screens freezing and lag. My system is pretty decent, though both of my hard-drives are old (one from '07, and one from '05) though they still hold data perfectly; nothing seems to be corrupt. I've tried to run the game as an admin, and through compatibility mode (Vista I ask after trying to go through my specs for Witcher 2. I _think_ I can run it. And after looking through several other graphic intensive games. I'm honestly not too confident if I can. So, is there an easy way to have a consistent answer? Is there a way to know? How do you look? How did you get used to knowing? Just curious because with all these numbers and video card names I don't always know if my NVIDIA GeForce GT 755M is better than some other Nvidia something something some other. Basically the title says it all, I tried connecting to both a Singleplayer and Multiplayer server but I just crash immediately with that error. Yesterday Window's was pestering me to update to Windows 8.1 and I accidentally clicked "Ok" and the damn thing never gave a cancel option. If anyone knows how to get back to just 8 but keep all my files that would help as well because this wasn't happening with Windows 8. Any help anyone, I'll post any info you need.

Java 7, Update 67 is installed. I actually don't know what the frames per second were before, but I couldn't even use the crafting table to place wooden planks in place to make a chest without serious trouble controlling the mouse. After the fix I'm running at about 48fps. I'm on a NVidia GEForce GTX on a brand new laptop. I was advised (from the Minecraft tech support chat) to go to my NVidia options and make sure the CPU option was selected under 'select PhysX configuration', and to select. Back in January, I decided to do something about the lack of data everyone keeps talking about regarding shuffler complaints. Three weeks ago in mid March, I posted on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/b21u3n/i_analyzed_shuffling_in_a_million_games/) about my results, to much ensuing discussion. Various people pointed out flaws in the study, perceived or real, and some of them I agree are serious issues. Perhaps more importantly, the study was incomplete - I tested whether. #TL;DR: By using a different Java VM we can reduce even the biggest modpacks memory usage by over 1 gigabyte, reduce CPU usage, and save up to a minute in loading times. Instructions on how to accomplish this are at the bottom of the post. I've spent the last two days comparing two Java VMs head to head to see which is better for Minecraft. What is a Java VM? Well, Java is a programming language, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is what runs this language essentially. The two I compar. Hi, I'm trying to create a Gatsby plugin wrapper for a Remark plugin. I'm running into an issue where the attacher function runs, but the returned transformer function doesn't.
