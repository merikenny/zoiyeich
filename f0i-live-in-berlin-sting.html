Hi folks. So I am presently STing a V20 Dark Ages Vampire game and my players have suggested doing a "modern nights" 2010s game using V20. (We won't be using V5.)

My name is William Jennings Arnett and I live in West Virginia. I am 84 years old, having been born on July 19th, 1917. I was in the Tank Destroyer Unit, I guess you could call it an Armored Unit, and we were attached to the Fifth Infantry Division, and later on to the 26th Infantry Division during World War II. I would eventually be discharged as a Private First Class, but I had other ranks during my several years of service. However that is the way I was discharged 
I used to work in the concert industry and since leaving I find myself more and more searching for great performances on blu ray. I love the way they look and sound, this blu ray is simply awesome, sting shows that he's a real artists with talent that few can truly claim.

They think and dream of nothing but chicanery. Their great joy consists in fault- finding, shrieking and threats. They brandish arms which are like barbed clubs; from their mouths instead of ordinary human speech, issue the rumbling of artillery and the clash of steel; their life is one of perpetual explosion.

Post Mortem Here's the breakdown from the master list. Admittedly I left Chance in the Unlikely section due to my own stubborn nature and really not believing that Huka would double up on a headliner from Sasquatch. Live and learn.

Now they were not merely puppets in brown uniforms. They were not going through the motions of soldiering with three thousand miles of ocean between them and English soil. They were actually in the heart of England itself. They were waiting for the arrival Review from the American Songwriter by Rick Moore The confidence and star quality that makes Sting Sting are as vibrant as ever on Live In Berlin, a recording taken from the ambitious Symphonicity tour that saw Sting present a symphonic career retrospective to sellout crowds worldwide.
